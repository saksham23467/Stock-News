# Stock News Alert System

This Python script tracks the stock price of a specified company and sends SMS alerts when there is a significant change in the stock price. If the price fluctuates by more than 5% between two consecutive days, it fetches the latest news articles related to the company and sends them via SMS using Twilio.

## Features
- Fetches daily stock prices using the Alpha Vantage API.
- Calculates the percentage change between consecutive days.
- Retrieves the top 3 news articles related to the company when significant price changes occur.
- Sends SMS notifications with stock movement details and news headlines.
